**Intent behind the choice of topic**
     While reviewing recent suicide statistics in India, I discovered that Tamil Nadu ranks second in the total number of suicide cases reported. This finding deeply concerned me and led me to explore the underlying causes behind these incidents. 
      Despite the state’s progress in education, employment, and access to resources, the suicide rate remains alarmingly high. I felt a strong need to understand why individuals—especially those who seem socially and economically stable—are still taking such drastic steps.
     Through this exploration, I aimed to gather insights that could help raise awareness, encourage mental health support, and hopefully contribute to reducing these numbers through collective societal and governmental action.

**The government and society must take urgent steps:**
Launch awareness and mental wellness campaigns across schools, colleges, and workplaces.

Establish counseling camps and stress relief initiatives for all age groups.

"Consider the impact of policy changes—like inflation, law reforms, and price hikes—on middle- and lower-class citizens
, who may silently bear the brunt of such pressures."

Offer accessible mental health services and create safe spaces for people to speak up without judgment.

​As of April 2025, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has not yet released suicide statistics for the year 2024. 
The most recent available data is from 2022, which indicates that Maharashtra reported the highest number of suicides, with 22,746 cases, accounting for 13.3% of the total suicides in India. Following Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu reported 19,834 cases (11.6%), and Madhya Pradesh had 15,386 cases (9%).
